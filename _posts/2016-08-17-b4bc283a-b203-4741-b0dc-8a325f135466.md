![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/52ed3130-4eb2-442d-8a1a-2327aaaf3431.jpg)

### A sweet and simple, sometimes hilarious love story, with a sprinkle of magical realism, that follows a pure hearted young woman on a wild, fantastical and occasionally scary road trip as she searches for her one true love in the mythical apple country of Ithaca, New York.

### Evie, a wistful and lonely girl living in Brooklyn, has fallen in love with a very special kind of apple, the apples with a \#94317 sticker. Or rather, she's never fallen out of love with a handsome young apple farmer she met in her youth and who she fantasizes is picking these apples just for her.

### When her fantasies begin to take a life of their own, and living with her overly controlling brother becomes impossible, Evie hits the road.

### Compelled to find the mysterious apple farmer of her dreams, Evie has to navigate America's back roads and a weird and wonderful cast of characters who try to exploit her simple goodness and break her faith in love before finding true romance in this touching and quirky fable.

### A romance wrapped in magical realism about a young woman's search for love and meaning.
